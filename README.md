# Holycorn: PostgreSQL multi-purpose Ruby data wrapper

(m)Ruby + PostgreSQL = &lt;3

Holycorn makes it easy to implement a Foreign Data Wrapper using Ruby.

It is based on top of mruby, that provides sandboxing capabilities the regular
Ruby VM "MRI/CRuby" does not provide.

## INSTALLATION

### Prerequisites

* PostgreSQL 9.1+

### Setup

Clone and build `mruby` inside the vendor directory

```console
cd vendor
git clone https://github.com/mruby/mruby.git
cd mruby
make
cd ../..
```

Building `holycorn` is as simple as

```console
make
```

and installing it only requires oneself to

```console
make install
```

Now you can start setting up the Foreign Data Wrapper:

```sql
DROP EXTENSION holycorn CASCADE;
CREATE EXTENSION holycorn;
CREATE SERVER holycorn_server FOREIGN DATA WRAPPER holycorn;
CREATE FOREIGN TABLE holytable (some_date timestampz) \
  SERVER holycorn_server
  OPTIONS (wrapper_path '/tmp/source.rb');
```

And the source file of the wrapper:

```ruby
# /tmp/source.rb
class Producer
  def initialize(env = {}) # env contains informations provided by Holycorn
  end

  def each
    @enum ||= Enumerator.new do |y|
      10.times do |t|
        y.yield [ Time.now ]
      end
    end
    @enum.next
  end
  self
end
```

Now you can select data out of the wrapper:

    Î» psql
    psql (9.4.1)
    Type "help" for help.

    franck=# SELECT * FROM holytable;
          some_date

     2015-06-21 22:39:24

    (10 rows)

Pretty neat.

# SUPPORTED SCRIPTS

## General rules

Any type of Ruby object can act as a FDW. The only requirements are that it can
receive `.new` (with arity = 1) and return an object that can receive `each` (arity = 0).

It doesn't **have** to be a `Class`, and there's currently no will to provide a
superclass to be inherited from.

In future versions, there will be many more callbacks to interact with PG's FDW
infrastructure through `Holycorn`.

Also, the script can only be a single word - like `MyClass` - as long as
`MyClass` has been defined and exists within your compilation of `mruby`.


## Environment

A hash is passed by `Holycorn` to the Ruby script. Its current keys are:

* `PG_VERSION`
* `PG_VERSION_NUM`
* `PACKAGE_STRING`
* `PACKAGE_VERSION`
* `MRUBY_RUBY_VERSION`
* `WRAPPER_PATH`

## Arbitraty Ruby objects

  * Time (Ruby) => `timestampz`

## CONFIGURATION

### Server

TBD;

### Foreign Table

TBD;

## TODO

- [ ] Array type
- [ ] JSON type
- [ ] Range type
- [ ] Support PG 9.5's `IMPORT FOREIGN SCHEMA` for easy setup

## Note on Patches/Pull Requests

* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with version or history. (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
